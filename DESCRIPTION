Description: Evaluates the probability density function of the sum of the
	Gaussian and Student's t density on 3 degrees of freedom.
	Evaluates the p.d.f. of the sphered Student's t density function. 
	Also evaluates the erf, and erfc functions on 
        complex-valued arguments. Thanks to Krishna Myneni the function
	is calculates the Faddeeva function also!
